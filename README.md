# Csecp256k1

This library is intended to make up-to-date libsecp256k1 available as a swift package. Added files are located in `Sources/spm-compat`. 

I have consulted the config file in [secp256k1.swift](https://github.com/Boilertalk/secp256k1.swift). And of course, all credits for `libsecp256k1` goes to [bitcoin-core](https://github.com/bitcoin-core).
